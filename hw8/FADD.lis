  **warning** (FADD.sp:6) runlvl smaller than 5, reset to 5 when accurate turned on
  **info** Monte Carlo simulation is detected, increase number of measure digits to 7 for Monte Carlo post processing.

 **warning**  runlvl smaller than 5, reset to 5 when accurate turned on
  **info** (FADD.sp:27) DC voltage reset to initial transient source value in source 0:va0. new dc=0.0000D+00
  **warning** (pmos_vtl:m_i_10 (/afs/umbc.edu/users/b/r/brianw5/home/CMPE691/hw8/all_gates:86)) Warning:  Acde = 0.300892 may be too small in BSIM4 model with w=3.15e-07 l=5e-08.
*** info *** index=1 is a nominal sample in Monte Carlo.
*** info *** The MCG Random Number Generator and .Option Use_Agauss_Format = Yes are set as defaults starting with HSPICE L-2016.06 to address the needs of advanced technology nodes with large samples and/or large circuits, particularly for distributed processing.
*** Should you want backward compatibility, please use the following options:
For traditional Gaussian style variations, use .Option Random_Generator = 3LC;
For Variation Block style variations, use .Option Random_Generator = MOA.
  
      

MONTE CARLO DEFINITIONS


Option sampling_method was set, variation block and agauss format variation are in effect.

Random number generator is MCG            , and seed =      1, stream =   1
 **info** set option symb=1 internally to help for convergence.
