For some reason, the 3rd arbiter chain of the third PUF kept giving me values
around 0.25 volts, regardless of the Gauss parameters. This is in between a 
one and a zero, so I adjusted a '0' to 0.3 volts in the AtD python script.

For intra hamming distance, I only compared challenge pairs [0, 1] [2, 3] ...
[13, 14] because these are the only challenges with 1 bit difference.

To calculate metrics, use the HD.py file:
python HD.py <PUF1_dig.txt> <PUF2_dig.txt> ... <PUF8_dig.txt>

For inter hamming distance, took the average hamming distance bewteen each
unique PUF pair for each challenge.

For uniformity, I took the proportion of 1's to 0's for every PUF.

For bit-flip, I took the proportion of 1's to 0's for each bit of every
challenge between each PUF

The output of the last 2 challenges should be the same, because the chllenges
are identical.

The metrics I calculated for each PUF are not ideal, with a strong trend toward
0.

To generate a new spice file with a different challenge, run the command:
./GenPUFSp.sh <challenge file> <output spice file>

Run the generated spice file normally with:
hspice <output spice file> -o <output lis file>
